# Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based approach for detecting tomato leaf diseases using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed system, called **PCA DeepNet**, combines the strengths of PCA and CNNs to classify tomato leaf images as healthy or diseased and detect various disease categories.

## 🛠 Methodology
The **PCA DeepNet** system consists of the following steps:  
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - The dataset is pre-processed and augmented to increase its size and diversity.
   
2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - PCA is used to extract features from the pre-processed images.
   
3. **Classification:**  
   - A customized CNN classifier is used to classify the images as healthy or diseased.
   
4. **Detection:**  
   - A Faster Region-Based CNN (F-RCNN) is used to detect specific disease categories.
